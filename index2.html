		<h5><p><br> "When I was younger there are times that I've been insecure of myself. That's why I also want to help other girls out there to be more confident of themselves as I am right now. I felt being low and insecure on my flaws. That is why this company (icon) aims to make  products that will make you proud and confident to yourselves and it is named as icon so each and everyone will be someone's icon which means you yourelf should be the role model to everyone but of course before being an icon you must be proud of yourself, don't let the insecurities devour you. Embrace your flaws as you embrace your dreams." <br> - Jhemarie Estoque </h5></p>
